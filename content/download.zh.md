# openEuler v1.0.0(以下内容翻译)

What's New?

1. v1.0.0 provides service mesh capabilities on the edge. Pod-to-pod communication on the same edge node or across edge nodes in the same subnet is supported.

2. This feature enables edged to communicate with a CRI-compliant runtime to manage containers running on resource constrained edge nodes. Support for containerd is tested.

3. Modbus Mapper to connect and control devices that use Modbus(RTU/TCP) as a communication protocol.

4. Edge-controller which connects to Kubernetes api-server and sync node/pod status between edge and kubernetes api-server.
